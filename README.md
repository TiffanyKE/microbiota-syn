# microbiota-syn
targeting gut microbiota for the improvement of obesity via synbiotics

The objective of this project is to have a deep understanding on the effects of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics on the alleviation of obesity and it's related metabolic disorders via the regulation of gut microbiota.

To achieve so, a high-fat diet induced obesity mouse model was used to validate the effects of pro-, pre- and synbiotics on obesity by monitoring those host-related metabolic parameters. The host-related parameters were monitored to validate the effects of our dietary interventions. To understand the mechanisms regarding to how the interventions regulate the gut microbiota and the related metabolic pathways, high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metaproteomics and metabolomics approaches were used to profile the microbial populations, abundance of microbial-related functional proteins and metabolites.
